```
Carmen has been the subject of many recordings, 
beginning with early wax cylinder recordings of excerpts in the 1890s, 

a nearly complete performance in German from 1908 with Emmy Destinn in the title role

a complete 1911 Opéra-Comique recording in French. 

Since then, many of the leading opera houses and artistes have recorded the work, in both studio and live performances. 
Over the years many versions have been commended and reissued.

From the mid-1990s numerous video recordings have become available. 

These include David McVicar's Glyndebourne production of 2002, and the Royal Opera productions of 2007 and 2010, 
each designed by Francesca Zambello.
