After Bizet's death, his friend Ernest Guiraud adapted key musical themes from Carmen 
into two symphonic suites that are frequently programmed by orchestras.

In 1883, the Spanish violinist and composer Pablo de Sarasate (1844–1908) 
wrote a Carmen Fantasy for violin, described as "ingenious and technically difficult".

Ferruccio Busoni's 1920 piece, Piano Sonatina No. 6 (Fantasia da camera super Carmen), 
is based on themes from Carmen.

In 1967 the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin adapted parts of the Carmen music into a ballet, 
the Carmen Suite, written specifically for his wife Maya Plisetskaya, 
then the Bolshoi Ballet's principal ballerina.

The character "Carmen" has been a regular subject of film treatment since the earliest days of cinema. 
The films were made in various languages and interpreted by several cultures, 
and have been created by prominent directors including Raoul Walsh (1915),[101] 
Cecil B. DeMille (1915),[102] Otto Preminger (1954) and Jean-Luc Godard (1984).[103] 

Preminger's Carmen Jones was adapted from a 1943 Broadway musical of the same name. 
The story is transposed to 1940s Chicago, and employs an all-black cast.[104] Francesco Rosi's film of 1984, 
with Julia Migenes and Plácido Domingo, is generally faithful to the original story and to Bizet's music.[105] 
Carmen on Ice (1990), starring Katarina Witt, Brian Boitano and Brian Orser, was inspired by 
Witt's gold medal-winning performance during the 1988 Winter Olympics.[106] 

Robert Townsend's 2001 film, Carmen: A Hip Hopera, starring Beyoncé Knowles, 
is a more recent attempt to create an African-American version.[107]

Carmen was also interpreted in modern Ballet by South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo
